# Agently Skills Catalog

This package publishes the current Agently Skills catalog generation `v2` under
`skills/`. The frozen V1 catalog is archived under `legacy/v1/` and is not part
of default installation, routing, or bundle guidance.

Use this file as installation-time guidance after the skills are added into another project or agent environment.

## Usage Priorities

- Route unresolved product, assistant, and workflow requests through `agently-playbook` first.
- Prefer Agently-native capabilities before custom output parsers, retry loops, or orchestration layers.
- Apply Occam's razor to APIs, architecture, and examples: do not add a new entity,
  method, facade, or compatibility patch when an existing Agently surface already
  carries the concept clearly. Prefer a narrow alias or docs clarification for unclear names.
- Default to async-first guidance for services, streaming, TriggerFlow, and concurrent execution. Treat sync APIs as wrappers for scripts, REPL use, or compatibility bridges unless there is a clear reason not to.
- Treat `agently-devtools` as an optional companion package installed from PyPI, not as a required source-repo dependency.
- Keep public skill boundaries capability-first and mutually exclusive.
- Treat multi-agent, judge, and review flows as scenario recipes unless they need a dedicated framework surface.
- Do not recommend `legacy/v1/` for new projects; it exists only for explicit
  rollback or historical projects.

## Coordinated Release Rules

- For an Agently framework release, validate the main repository and companion repositories before merging or publishing.
- Feature acceptance is not complete until each relevant spec records the final
  implemented design, any fully landed planned spec has moved to `spec/implemented/`,
  and `spec/README.md` points to the completed location.
- When reporting public API, recommended usage, examples, or compatibility-line
  changes, include concise sample code that shows the updated usage shape.
  Prefer current usage snippets or before/after snippets over abstract prose
  when that will make the change easier to inspect.
- Version numbers are part of the release-prep change and must be updated before final validation, merging, or publishing; do not rely on post-publish metadata-only edits to trigger a release workflow.
- Development-line planning must not change package release numbers. In the
  main repository, do not update `pyproject.toml`, `agently/compatibility.py`,
  `compatibility/index.json` `latest_release`, or create
  `compatibility/releases/<future-version>.json` only to mark the next planned
  version. Use `compatibility/in-development.json` for the next target until an
  actual release-prep change begins.
- The main repository release commit must update `pyproject.toml`, `agently/compatibility.py`, `compatibility/index.json`, and the matching `compatibility/releases/<version>.json`; keep `compatibility/in-development.json` aligned until the release line moves on.
- If the release recommends a new `agently-devtools` build, update the DevTools package version in `../Agently-Devtools/packages/python/pyproject.toml` during the same release-prep pass; changing only docs, tests, or compatibility text does not trigger the DevTools publish workflow.
- Keep the Agently DevTools `recommended_version_specifier` in the current release manifest aligned with the version that will be published to PyPI.
- Before creating or updating the main repository PR, run `pyright` and `python -m pytest` in the main repository, using the same Python environment that will validate the release.
- Before considering this Skills repository aligned, run `python validate/validate_compatibility.py`, `python validate/validate_catalog.py`, `python validate/validate_bundle_manifest.py`, `python validate/validate_trigger_paths.py`, and `python validate/validate_native_usage.py`.
- Before considering `../Agently-Devtools` aligned, run `pyright --pythonpath "$(command -v python)"` and `python -m pytest packages/python/tests`; after push, confirm the GitHub Actions CI and publish workflow results.
- DevTools CI must work with the checkout layout used by `.github/workflows/ci.yml`; tests must not assume only a sibling `../Agently` checkout when the workflow checks Agently out as `agently-src`.
- Check whether companion repository heads are already merged into `origin/main`; if they are, treat them as no-op rather than creating unnecessary merge commits.
- If a companion repository has unrelated local dirty files, do not overwrite them. Report the dirty state if it affects release validation.
- PR titles and bodies for release work must not mention Codex, coding-agent internals, or generated-by metadata.
- If any release validation fails, list the failure and stop before merging, publishing, or creating the main release PR.

## Model Example Guidance

- User-visible feature work must add or update examples for the scenario the
  feature enables before the task is considered complete. The example should be
  runnable in its declared environment, use the current recommended API shape,
  and keep an `Expected key output` comment with stable key values from one real
  run. Do not replace that with a generic statement such as "shows X". When the
  behavior is not obvious from output alone, add concise working-principle notes
  or an ASCII flow diagram in the example comment.
- Agently recommended examples, cookbook examples, public teaching examples, and training-derived examples must exercise a real model through DeepSeek or local Ollama.
- DeepSeek credentials may be loaded through dotenv by the example itself. Do not mark DeepSeek unavailable only because `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` is absent from the parent shell environment.
- Model-owned planner, router, decomposer, evaluator, reviser, action selector, and response generator behavior must not be replaced with mock, deterministic, or hand-written local substitutes.
- Local functions may be used only as business capabilities, Actions, fake external systems, executor/provider smoke targets, or deterministic resources called by the model-driven flow.
- Low-level infrastructure smoke examples may run without a model only when they are explicitly scoped to executor/provider behavior and are not presented as model-app patterns.

## Project Defaults

- Prefer separating `settings/`, `prompts/`, `services/`, `domain/` or `schemas/`, `workflow/`, `tools/`, and `tests/` when the project is more than a tiny demo.
- Keep stable shared prompt and output contracts in prompt config rather than scattering them across Python helpers.
- Keep provider settings under the namespace actually read by the active plugin. For `OpenAICompatible`, prefer `plugins.ModelRequester.OpenAICompatible.*`.
- Prefer `Agently.load_settings("yaml_file", path, auto_load_env=True)` for file-backed settings. Use `Agently.set_settings(...)` for inline overrides.
- Keep optional DevTools wiring in the integration layer through `ObservationBridge`, `EvaluationBridge`, or `create_local_observation_app` instead of scattering debug hooks across workflow code.

## Skill Routing Reminders

- `agently-playbook`: unresolved owner layer, project shape, or broad product request
- `agently-request`: provider wiring, env placeholders, model settings, prompt config, structured output, response reuse, session memory, embeddings, and retrieval
- `agently-runtime`: Action Runtime, tools, MCP, Execution Environment, FastAPIHelper, `auto_func`, `KeyWaiter`, and optional `agently-devtools` observation, evaluation, and playground integration
- `agently-triggerflow`: explicit orchestration, branching, concurrency, runtime stream, workflow-owned business events, and execution-graph-friendly workflow definitions
- `agently-migration`: migration from LangChain, LangGraph, LlamaIndex, CrewAI, or similar systems into Agently-native layers

## Anti-Patterns

- Do not treat sync sample code as the default architecture for async-capable services.
- Do not expose raw model parser paths directly to the UI when the workflow can translate them into stable business events.
- Do not keep provider auth, model name, or base URL in ad hoc Python literals when settings plus `${ENV.xxx}` placeholders fit.
- Do not tell users to clone or editable-install the private DevTools source when the public package `pip install agently-devtools` already matches the supported integration path.
