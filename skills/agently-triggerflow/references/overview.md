# Overview

This skill owns TriggerFlow orchestration, execution state, runtime stream, sub-flow boundaries, workflow-side model execution, output-fan-out refactors, process-clarity refactors, and mixed sync/async orchestration.

Prefer async-first flow handlers and execution APIs. When the UI needs progressive updates, bridge model-side structured streaming into workflow-side runtime stream items so the frontend consumes stable business events instead of raw parser paths.

Prefer explicit execution lifecycle control. New TriggerFlow code should create or start an execution, let chunks update execution state, and finish with `close()` or `async_close()` so pending non-blocking work and runtime stream consumers are drained consistently. Avoid using result polling as the default completion contract.

Use `execution.result` when code needs more than one view of the same execution outcome. It is a facade over execution-owned state, not a second result store. Use `await execution.async_close()` for the finalized close snapshot, `execution.result.get_state("key")` for state reads before or after close, `await execution.result.async_get_final_result()` only for compatibility final-result bridging, and `execution.result.get_meta()` for execution id, flow name, status, lifecycle state, timestamps, close reason, and state version. Intervention-aware code may use `execution.result.get_interventions(...)` when the runtime intervention ledger is enabled; otherwise the reader is an empty-list no-op.

For short scripts that need a synchronous wrapper, `flow.start(...)` is acceptable as an outer boundary: it waits for execution close and returns the close snapshot. If legacy `.end()` / `set_result()` compatibility is present, the snapshot may include `"$final_result"`. Hidden `flow.start(...)` uses immediate idle auto-close by default; do not use it as the default service/streaming pattern, and keep an execution handle plus explicit `close()` / `async_close()` for services.

Use execution-managed nowait emit for event fan-out that should not block the current chunk. Prefer `emit_nowait(...)` / `async_emit_nowait(...)` over raw `asyncio.create_task(data.async_emit(...))` so the execution can register the task and drain it during `close()` / `async_close()`.

Treat auto-close as the default for short workflows and manual close as the service/worker pattern for long-running or externally driven executions. A manual-close execution keeps accepting events until user code calls `close()` / `async_close()`.

Treat `pause_for(...)` as a durable graph interrupt. New approval or webhook examples should choose an explicit `resume_to`: use `"next"` when the resume payload should flow to the downstream chunk, `"self"` when the same model-owned chunk should re-enter with `data.is_resume` / `data.resume`, and `{"event": "..."}` for signal-routed continuation. Use model-owned `pause_for(..., resume_to="self")` for autonomous model-decided interrupts. Use an explicit pause chunk plus `when(...)` for prearranged human approval gates. `resume_event=...` is compatibility guidance for older event-routed examples, not the default teaching path.

When a sub-flow may pause, external systems should resume only the root execution. Child interrupts are projected into root pending interrupts; callers store the root execution id and root interrupt id, then call `root_execution.continue_with(...)`. Re-inject required `runtime_resources` when restoring a saved root execution.

Use execution state (`get_state(...)`, `set_state(...)`, and async variants) for per-execution data. Flow data is shared across executions and should be treated as a risky internal/shared-state surface rather than normal workflow memory.

For service packaging, treat ordinary `TriggerFlow(...)` as the definition/planning surface and `create_execution(...)` / `start_execution(...)` as the boundary into one run. Prefer module-level named chunks and conditions. Put stable live dependencies such as `agent_factory`, clients, prompt paths, or loggers into flow-level `runtime_resources`; put request- or tenant-specific values into execution-level `runtime_resources`. Chunks should read required live dependencies with `data.require_resource(...)` and write per-request business values to execution state. Closures are acceptable for compact scripts, but they are not the recommended service shape because they reduce handler reuse, testing, and config/blueprint round-trip clarity.

For model-app dynamic planning, keep reusable main flows and sub-flow templates module-safe, then compile model-generated To-Do Lists or dependency graphs into request-local or plan-local executors. Use task ids as dynamic stage identities, drive dependency execution with `when(...)` + `emit_nowait(...)`, and store generated plan data and task results in execution input/state rather than shared flow data. Definition idempotence prevents duplicate graph declarations; it must not dedupe runtime signals, because repeated emits are real business events.

In Agently `v4.1.2.5`, TriggerFlow definitions, chunk signal metadata, origin-chunk payloads, resume context, and sub-flow interrupt projection are strong enough to support graph-oriented debugging and local DevTools visualization without duplicating the workflow description.
