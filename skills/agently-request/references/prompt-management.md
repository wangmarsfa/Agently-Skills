# Agently Prompt Management

Use this skill when the core problem is how prompt state should be structured before one request or request family runs.

## Native-First Rules

- prefer `input(...)`, `instruct(...)`, `info(...)`, and `output(...)` over concatenated prompt strings
- move reusable prompt structure into prompt config or YAML instead of ad hoc literals
- keep runtime variables as `${...}` placeholders in prompt files and inject them through mappings at load time
- use render-time slot references when one prompt slot should point the model to
  another slot without duplicating its value: `${INPUT.foo}` -> `[INPUT > foo]`,
  `${INFO.customer}` -> `[INFO > customer]`, `${INSTRUCT.step}` ->
  `[INSTRUCT > step]`, and `${OUTPUT}` -> `[OUTPUT REQUIREMENT]`. Slot names are
  case-insensitive; examples should use uppercase. Do not validate the path
  after the slot name because it is a model-facing reference label, not a value
  extraction
- keep task-specific request contracts in prompt config, and keep only widely reused persona setup in small code-side factories
- when the output contract is stable and shared across a request family, keep it
  in prompt config such as `.turn.output` instead of rebuilding it ad hoc in
  Python. `.request` remains accepted as a compatibility alias for `.turn`
- Agent quick prompt chains create AgentTurn-local request drafts. Expression-local
  chaining can configure and run one turn directly, for example
  `agent.input(...).output(...).async_start()`. If setup is split across
  statements, conditions, helper calls, or later configuration steps, capture
  `turn = agent.create_turn()` and mutate that turn with
  `turn.set_turn_prompt(...)` or quick prompt methods; do not rely on shared
  Agent request-scoped prompt accumulation. `set_request_prompt(...)` remains a
  compatibility alias for `set_turn_prompt(...)`. Agent-level persistent setup
  remains on `always=True`, `set_agent_prompt(...)`, settings, and stable prompt
  config.
- set structured output format in prompt config with `$format` inside the
  `output` block when the contract needs a fixed mode, for example
  `.turn.output.$format: json`, `flat_markdown`, `hybrid`, `xml_field`,
  `yaml_literal`, or `auto`. This maps to the same Prompt slot as
  `.output(..., format=...)`; `.format`, `$output_format`, and
  `.output_format` are accepted aliases
- keep prompt composition separate from transport and orchestration
- use config files as an editable bridge when UI or product teams need to adjust prompt-driven behavior without rewriting workflow code

## Anti-Patterns

- do not flatten business context into one opaque string unless the task is trivial
- do not rebuild prompt templates through ad hoc `.format(...)` or string concatenation when prompt mappings already fit
- do not duplicate a large slot into another slot just to refer to it; use
  `${INPUT...}` / `${INFO...}` / `${INSTRUCT...}` references so the rendered
  prompt points at the existing section
- do not scatter stable prompt or output contracts across multiple Python helpers when one prompt config can own them
- do not invent a parallel prompt DSL for workflows or task nodes; use a
  `prompt` field with Configure Prompt shape when an internal model request
  needs configurable `input`, `instruct`, `output`, or `output_format`
- do not use prompt config files as a substitute for workflow state
