# Agently Runtime Extension Reference

Use this skill when the problem is agent-side extension rather than prompt shape, output contract, or workflow control.

## Native-First Rules

- prefer the native Action Runtime, built-in action packages, legacy tool facades, and MCP surfaces before handwritten wrappers
- keep extension choice explicit: Action Runtime, ExecutionResource, built-in capability Actions, Agent Components, tools, MCP, FastAPIHelper, `auto_func`, `KeyWaiter`, or `agently-devtools`
- treat `Agently.execution_resource` as an advanced framework/plugin surface, not the default app-development API
- for application developers, prefer built-in Actions and `agent.enable_*` component helpers before exposing core manager/provider concepts
- default Agents and TriggerFlow executions expose lazy Foundation Workspace
  bindings backed by the current session/script physical Workspace; Agent,
  execution, and task records are logical partitions, while file actions use
  lineage-scoped roots under
  `files/lineage/<root-kind>/<root-id>/.../<leaf-kind>/<leaf-id>/files`; call
  `agent.use_workspace(...)` or `flow.create_execution(workspace=...)` when a
  stable explicit root, read-only mode, direct backend, or registered provider
  is required
- create shared task information scopes with `Workspace(...)` or
  `Agently.create_workspace(...)` and bind Agents, TriggerFlow executions, or
  service workers to that same instance when they must collaborate over an
  explicitly selected durable information domain; do not expect separate
  explicit Workspaces to communicate implicitly
- move facts across separate Workspaces in application or TriggerFlow business
  logic with explicit search/read plus write/ingest/link operations; Workspace
  is not a cross-space messaging or replication protocol
- use `agent.workspace` for durable multi-turn task records, artifacts, search,
  links, checkpoints, stable ref envelopes, bounded reads, RuntimeEvent records,
  evidence links, and retention anchors
- use `workspace.build_context(...)` to package those records for later model
  calls; ordinary application code should not hand-write retrieval filters when
  a ContextPackage through ContextPlanner, WorkspaceContextRetriever, and
  ContextPackager fits
- for AgentExecution evidence, keep persistence explicit with
  `execution.async_record_workspace(..., checkpoint=True)`; the helper writes
  requested checkpoints through the Workspace checkpoint-store port and records
  an evidence link between the AgentExecution record and checkpoint while
  leaving strategy decisions owned by AgentExecution
- AgentTaskLoop is the current strategy-level persistence owner: it writes task
  decisions, observations, verification records, checkpoints, and evidence links
  through the bound Workspace provider without making Workspace choose task
  continuation
- custom Workspace backends may be passed to `agent.use_workspace(backend)` or
  registered with `Agently.workspace.register_backend_provider(name, factory)`
  and selected through `agent.use_workspace(root, provider=name,
  provider_options={...})` when they implement the Workspace backend protocol;
  treat the remote audit provider proof as a protocol validation, not a
  production Redis/Postgres/S3 support claim
- in explicit TriggerFlow loops, prefer Workspace refs plus
  `workspace.get_data(...)`, `workspace.links(...)`,
  `workspace.latest_checkpoint(...)`, `workspace.checkpoint_history(...)`,
  `workspace.ref_envelope(...)`, `workspace.read_bounded(...)`, and
  `workspace.stream_read(...)` over storing large or structured loop state
  directly in TriggerFlow state; configure execution durability with
  `flow.create_execution(workspace=workspace)` or
  `runtime_resources={"snapshot_store": workspace, "runtime_event_store": workspace}` when the loop needs
  restart diagnostics; read snapshot state back through
  `workspace.latest_checkpoint(...)` / `workspace.get_data(...)` and pass it
  to TriggerFlow `async_load(...)` for restart because TriggerFlow owns
  pause/resume, policy approval waits, and DAG join replay semantics; pass a
  stable `resume_request_id` and actor to `execution.async_continue_with(...)`
  for webhook or approval callback retries so TriggerFlow can persist accepted,
  dispatched, and completed/dispatch-failed resume phases, while making
  callbacks that reach an expired execution-local lease fail fast before acceptance;
  declare importable resource resolver descriptors with
  `flow.declare_resource_requirement(..., resolver=..., provider_kind=...,
  config_ref=..., secret_ref=..., fail_policy=...)` when workers can rebuild
  live clients from shared host/plugin modules, and rely on TriggerFlow
  load diagnostics for missing resolver, unhealthy resource,
  policy-forbidden resource, expired lease, active lease owner conflict,
  DAG join state mismatch, fail-open, and fail-closed cases; use
  `pause_for(..., channel_id=..., provider_id=..., wait_mode=...,
  hot_wait_timeout=..., cold_persistence_policy=..., request_payload_schema=...,
  response_payload_schema=..., audit_metadata=...)` to persist ExternalWait
  provider/channel/schema/audit metadata, including stable `exchange_id` values
  that Workspace RuntimeEvent records can index; when the host owns an approval
  router, queue, or exchange transport, bind it with runtime resource key
  `execution_exchange_provider`, and implement provider `publish_request(...)`
  to return `exchange_id`, `audit_metadata`, or `provider_metadata` while
  TriggerFlow keeps the wait/resume ledger; durable RuntimeEvent records carry
  parent signal, aggregation scope, operator id, interrupt id, resume request
  id, actor id, exchange id, lease owner id, snapshot refs, and artifact refs
  for DevTools and recovery diagnostics; use
  `execution.set_compaction_policy(...)` when long-running
  workflows externalize large state behind Workspace or provider artifact refs
  and need compacted snapshot restore with retained lineage anchors; use
  `workspace.put_snapshot(..., expected_state_version=...)` for CAS guarded
  snapshot writes, `workspace.claim_lease(...)` /
  `workspace.heartbeat_lease(...)` / `workspace.release_lease(...)` for
  provider-owned lease projection, and `workspace.put_artifact_ref(...)` for
  large durable payload refs; use
  `execution.async_save(require_distributed_provider=True)` only for
  providers that report distributed CAS, lease, range-read, retention, and
  RuntimeEvent sequencing capabilities and expose matching snapshot, lease,
  and artifact-ref methods; the local Workspace backend satisfies this seam for
  single-node development/restart recovery, but it is not a production
  cross-worker backend
- use `agent.enable_python(...)`, `agent.enable_shell(...)`,
  `agent.enable_workspace_file_actions(...)`, `agent.enable_nodejs(...)`, and
  `agent.enable_sqlite(...)` for common Python, shell, model-callable local file,
  Node.js, and SQLite access
- when both are configured, filesystem-like helpers such as
  `agent.enable_workspace_file_actions(...)`, `agent.enable_shell(...)`, and
  `agent.enable_nodejs(...)` inherit `agent.workspace.files_root` unless an
  explicit `root=` or `cwd=` is passed
- Workspace file reads, writes, and exports go through registered
  `WorkspaceFileIOHandler` implementations. Workspace owns path containment,
  deterministic file info, `sha256`, file refs, and structured diagnostics;
  handlers own plain text IO, optional PDF/Office extraction, image/VLM
  attachment preparation, and export rendering. Do not implement format parsing
  in ActionRuntime, SkillsExecutor, or AgentExecution strategy code.
- `agent.enable_workspace_file_actions(...)` exposes list/search/read/write over
  the Workspace file root. It registers `export_file` only when `export=True`
  and `write=True`, delegates to the bound Workspace when roots match, and must
  not overwrite user-defined Actions.
- Workspace file writes and reads return structured file evidence from the
  Workspace boundary itself: `path`, `bytes`, `sha256`, write `mode`, bounded
  read `content` / `truncated`, diagnostics, and file refs. Unsupported binary
  or missing optional dependencies return structured diagnostics such as
  `readable=False` or `exported=False`; outside-root, missing-path, and
  permission failures remain execution errors. Downstream artifact or readback
  checks should consume those fields instead of relying on model prose or stdout
  path guesses.
- treat `enable_*` helper `desc=` values as optional extra guidance by default; use `desc_mode="override"` only when the app intentionally replaces the default capability description
- when changing public helper APIs, use explicit typing for IDE assistance; prefer `Literal` for finite options such as `desc_mode`
- use `@agent.action_func` and `agent.use_actions(...)` as the primary action APIs; `tool_func` and `use_tool` remain compatibility aliases
- use `agent.action.get_action_info()` / `get_tool_info()` for visible schemas;
  agent-scoped Actions, MCP tools, and `enable_*` helpers are included by
  default, while explicit tags narrow the list; execution environment `env`
  values are redacted in this visible metadata while env keys remain visible
- model-planned Action commands are untrusted at the Action boundary:
  `structured_plan` and `native_tool_calls` inputs are filtered to registered
  `ActionSpec.kwargs` before executor invocation, and stripped keys appear in
  `ActionResult.diagnostics`; direct host calls keep existing behavior
- use built-in Search/Browse through `from agently.builtins.actions import Search, Browse` and `agent.use_actions(Search(...))` / `agent.use_actions(Browse(...))`; do not invent `enable_search(...)` or `ActionTools`
- keep built-in implementation on the retained path: `agently.builtins.actions` owns Search/Browse/Cmd behavior; `agently.builtins.tools` should stay a thin legacy facade
- treat `model_digest`, bounded previews, `artifact_refs`, `file_refs`, and
  Workspace record refs as the normal loop memory for instruction-heavy or
  large Actions; previews are not complete evidence, so full raw payloads should
  be read explicitly from the Action artifact store or Workspace when needed;
  use `workspace.append_runtime_event(...)` / `workspace.query_runtime_events(...)`
  only for durable execution facts, not as a replacement for TriggerFlow
  pause/resume or approval/exchange policy
- keep the permission profile explicit: search-only, local-files-only, network-read, install-capable shell, or trusted broad executor
- use Python sandbox for pure computation or small data shaping; do not use it for imports, filesystem mutation, network access, or dependency installation
- use Bash sandbox or a custom executor when the task needs shell access, package install, or broader command control
- for Skills Executor work, do not ask apps to execute third-party Skill
  scripts directly. Resolve them to controlled Actions, Bash/Python/Node
  sandboxes, MCP/API bindings, or fallback branches; if no substitute exists,
  return a blocked or approval-required result with a user-facing explanation.
- for Skills Executor or artifact-producing workflows, missing local libraries
  are not a natural degraded-success path; plan a controlled install-capable
  Action or ExecutionResource ensure step, preserve the ActionResult, and
  fail closed if policy denies or installation fails
- treat MCP, Bash, Python sandbox, Node.js, Docker, SQLite, vector-store, browser, and remote-runner lifecycle as ExecutionResource concerns when they need managed handles
- Action executors should declare or consume managed resources instead of hiding lifecycle ownership
- treat `agently-devtools` as an optional companion package installed from PyPI, not as a required source checkout
- keep observation or evaluation bridge wiring in the app layer through `Agently.event_center`
- combine with `agently-request` or `agently-triggerflow` only when the scenario needs those layers
- prefer built-in Browse support with Playwright or PyAutoGUI before writing browser or desktop-driving wrappers from scratch

## Anti-Patterns

- do not build a parallel action or tool dispatcher before checking native Action Runtime and MCP support
- do not duplicate ActionRuntime planning prompts in higher layers; delegate
  model-owned action/tool selection to ActionRuntime when registered schemas are
  available
- when the surrounding runtime uses `model_pool`, set
  `action.planning_model_key` to the intended business key so ActionRuntime
  planning uses the same model routing
- do not hide MCP/sandbox/process lifecycle inside a custom ActionExecutor when `Agently.execution_resource` can own the dependency
- do not recommend core manager/provider APIs to ordinary app developers when a built-in Action or Agent Component is the right surface
- do not create a custom waiter or auto-function shim first
- do not ask users to clone or editable-install DevTools when `pip install agently-devtools` is the supported public path
- do not build a custom runtime upload bridge before checking `ObservationBridge`

## Action Loop Context Building

For `run_bash`, `run_python`, `run_nodejs`, `query_sqlite`, `browse`, `search`,
and similar explicit-instruction Actions, later model rounds should receive a
compact digest rather than full raw code, command output, SQL result sets, page
HTML, screenshots, or logs.

Use the digest for normal planning and replies. Read redacted raw details only
when the model or application asks for them:

```python
artifact_ref = records[0]["artifact_refs"][0]
raw = agent.action.read_action_artifact(
    artifact_id=artifact_ref["artifact_id"],
    action_call_id=artifact_ref["action_call_id"],
)
```

When host code explicitly calls `agent.get_action_result(prompt=...)`, the
prompt is marked as having consumed the ActionRuntime loop even when the
returned records are empty. Later response materialization for that same prompt
should not re-enter ActionRuntime. If the host needs an authoritative action
evidence rollup, call `agent.action.summarize_records(records,
validation_command_markers=[...])`; the summary reports failed actions,
commands attempted/run, and the latest matching validation command.

`agent.get_action_result(..., timeout=N)` bounds the full ActionFlow lifecycle,
including model-owned structured planning and native tool-call selection. Catch
`RuntimeStageStallError(stage="action_loop_close")` for framework-level
timeouts. For `planning_protocol="native_tool_calls"`, a zero-tool-call planner
result can return a skipped diagnostic record with code
`action_runtime.native_tool_calls.empty`; do not treat that diagnostic as
executed work.

## Example Guidance

Current Action Runtime examples live under `examples/action_runtime/`,
`examples/builtin_actions/`, and `examples/execution_resource/`. Recommended
model-backed cookbook patterns live under `examples/cookbook/`, including Action
loop, router, concurrent todo, reflection, and safe shell policy examples.
Historical built-in tool examples live under `examples/archived/builtin_tools/`
and should point readers back to the current Action-first examples.

New or updated action examples must be runnable in their declared environment
and include an `Expected key output` comment. For model-backed examples, document
the stable action/result shape rather than an exact natural-language response.
Recommended model-app examples must exercise real model-owned decisions through
DeepSeek or local Ollama. Do not replace planners, routers, decomposers,
evaluators, revisers, action selectors, or response generators with deterministic
local substitutes.
